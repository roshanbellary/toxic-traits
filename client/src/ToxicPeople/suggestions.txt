For the frontend, we'd like to see you would implement both the group and individual pages! 
Take a look at the AdminDashboard folder and poke around to see how the AdminDashboardPage is defined, and how it uses UserTable.
This can be a good starting point for inspiration on how to divide up your files and what to put in each file,
as well as how to use MUI to render components and pages. 

We suggest to use MUI cards and grids to help with spacing of the components. You can also find ways to use MUI styling online!
